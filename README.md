[RedCap](https://lren.chuv.ch/redcap/) is a secure, web-based application for building and managing online surveys and databases.
It contains descriptions software, data and web packages being developped by the Human Brain Project (HBP). All the information stored in the redcap database can be extracted to an excel spread sheet. 

* **This program** takes as input the 'excel' spread sheet exported from redcap and saves this information in a structured human redable Microsoft Word document.
